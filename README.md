#York's project

* This project is for my ComIT class hold in Saskatoon in Jun and Sep of 2018.
* It's designed for residents in Saskatoon to browse, book/modify/cancel appointment with and evaluate the family physicians.
* In PHYSICIAN LIST page, you can browse the profile of physicians and jump to his/her clinic page. You can also book appointment if you think the physician is suitable for your condition, the name of such physician and clinic will be filled in appointment form automatically.
* In APPOINTMENT page, you fill your information then press BOOK. A confirming Email will be sent to you immediately after your sumbit. A reminding Email will be sent one day before your appointing day! You can browse and cancel your appointment.
* In CLINIC INFO page, you can leave the searching bar blank to search all the clinics, input the name of clinic or your community to specify the result. A embeded google map can help you see the location clearly.
* Some pages are under construction...
